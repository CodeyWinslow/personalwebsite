            <h2>KRONO</h2>
            <p>Professional grade mobile application developed by my Oregon Tech Junior Project team and I.
                Users create, manage, share, and collaborate to manage location-based plans. 
                The social features of this app are strongly emphasized and bring life to the 
                otherwise basic planning functionality. This application implements a friend system 
                with messaging, group chats, notifications, and collaborative planning. <br/><br/>
                Krono uses Google Firestore from Firebase as a backend database provider. The cloud-based 
                solution takes much of the work of managing a physical machine for our database out of the 
                development process, allowing us to focus on the important managerial tasks that 
                allow rapid development progress. <br/><br/>
                Java was our language of choice after giving Kotlin a chance. Kotlin was made the official 
                language of Android in 2018, so it made sense to start there. This proved to be more 
                difficult than the results we produced could justify, so we settled for the much more 
                widely supported and easier-to-debug Java language.
