            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am honored to see you here! I am currently an Oregon Tech student in the Computer 
                Software Engineering Technology program working for my first bachelor's degree, and I am  
                looking for a summer internship. <br/><br/>
            I was 11 when I started making video games, and I immediately fell in love with it. A program 
            called Game Maker 8 introduced me and gave me the tools to explore a different side of a 
            beloved medium I had grown up on. I didn't initially enjoy programming because of how 
            intimidating it was at the time, but when faced with a problem that required a simple form of 
            scripting, I fell in love with that, too! Since then, I have consistently built my programming 
            skills to set myself apart from the vast body of people who have the immense passion for video 
            games that I do.<br/><br/>
            My first two years after high school was spent at Umpqua Community College where I enjoyed every bit 
            of earning an Associate of Science degree in Computer Information Systems. I learned many valuable 
            skills and a substantial amound of knowledge in varying areas of technology, but I didn't get the 
            focus on software or games that I craved. As fate would have it, the Oregon Institute of Technology 
            fell right in front of me and I seized the opportunity. <br/><br/>
            I am now a Junior in the sofware engineering program at OIT, and I could not have anticipated the 
            skills and knowledge I have acquired this far. The progress I have made at Oregon Tech has helped 
            ensure that whatever team I am part of knows they can count on me to make quality work, communicate 
            efficiently, and understand my team members in a way that makes the workplace productive and enjoyable!</p>

            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>I am an inquisitive person. I like to understand how everything works because the world is fascinating. 
                If I had it my way, I would be an expert in everything even if I had to live a thousand lifetimes. 
                This lifetime, however, I have chosen to be an expert in software. <br/><br/>
                Although most of my life I have considered myself to be an overly structure-oriented person, I have 
                discovered the value of molding myself into a more well-rounded version. I truly admire every aspect 
                of game development. From the game / level / character design and asset creation to the complex and 
                genius engineering that goes into graphics, in-game systems, and gameplay mechanics. This admiration 
                manifests itself into the passion that drives me to be best I can be, and to one day deliver games 
                that make people feel the way I did as a child. <br/><br/>
                If I had to pick one trait that sets me apart from most people you (yes, you, the reader) have met, it 
                would be compassion. I spend close to half of my time emulating the perspectives of others, or at 
                least bettering myself by understanding their perspectives. In many ways, this influences me to be 
                hypercritical about myself, but I embrace this by using it to be self-aware.<br/><br/>
                If you want one thing to remember me by, know that not only my skills, but also my presence would 
                make a lasting impact on your project and your team!

            <h2>WHY HIRE ME?</h2>
            <p>Other than my claim that I am good at what I do, I think you would just enjoy having me around!<br/><br/>
                In case the "Personality" section seems to exhaustive, I'll summarize it here: I strive to be a 
                well-rounded person, and along with my technical skills, I empathize well with others.<br/><br/>
                In an ever-growing market of software engineers, it would be untruthful to say skilled programmers 
                are hard to come by. While many of my colleagues have put all of their efforts into building technical 
                skills, I have chosen to sacrifice some of that time to build myself as a person. I think you will 
                find not only my technical ability to be desirable, but you'll also find my personability to be a superb 
                addition to your team.</p>
