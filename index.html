            <h2 class="titleblock">A little about me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am honored to see you here! I am currently an Oregon Tech student in the Computer 
                Software Engineering Technology program working for my first bachelor's degree, and I am  
                looking for a summer internship. <br/><br/>
            I was 11 when I started making video games, and I immediately fell in love with it. I have consistently built my programming 
            skills to set myself apart from the vast body of people who have the immense passion for video 
            games that I do.<br/><br/>
            I am now a Junior in the sofware engineering program at OIT, and the progress I have made has helped 
            ensure that whatever team I am part of knows they can count on me to make quality work, communicate 
            efficiently, and understand my team members in a way that makes the workplace productive and enjoyable!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="whyhireme" class="panel">
            <p>Other than my claim that I am good at what I do, I think you would just enjoy having me around!<br/><br/>
                In case the "Personality" section seems too exhaustive, I'll summarize it here: I strive to be a 
                well-rounded person, and along with my technical skills, I empathize well with others.<br/><br/>
                In an ever-growing market of software engineers, it would be untruthful to say skilled programmers 
                are hard to come by. While many of my colleagues have put all of their efforts into building technical 
                skills, I have chosen to sacrifice some of that time to build myself as a person. I think you will 
                find not only my technical ability to be desirable, but you'll also find my personability to be a superb 
                addition to your team.</p>
