            <h2>KRONO</h2>
            <p>Professional grade mobile application developed by my Oregon Tech Junior Project team and I.
                Users create, manage, share, and collaborate to manage location-based plans. 
                The social features of this app are strongly emphasized and bring life to the 
                otherwise basic planning functionality. This application implements a friend system 
                with messaging, group chats, notifications, and collaborative planning. <br/><br/>
                Krono uses Google Firestore from Firebase as a backend database provider. The cloud-based 
                solution takes much of the work of managing a physical machine for our database out of the 
                development process, allowing us to focus on the important managerial tasks that 
                allow rapid development progress. <br/><br/>
                Java was our language of choice after giving Kotlin a chance. Kotlin was made the official 
                language of Android in 2018, so it made sense to start there. This proved to be more 
                difficult than the results we produced could justify, so we settled for the much more 
                widely supported and easier-to-debug Java language.

            <h2>RAPID RUN</h2>
            <p>After exploring the world of mobile game development, I started to catch on that people like 
                simplicity. Growing up on games that ensnare the player and totally absorb them in their story, 
                gameplay, and challenge, I wanted to bring that same feeling to the mobile platform; however, 
                the games that saw more success at the time were small, short-play arcade style games. Rapid 
                Run was my opening act, and it is the epitome of simplicity.<br/><br/>
                The idea of the game can be summed up very quickly: tap to move from left to right, and avoid the 
                blocks. These simple mechanics were easy enough that I was able to get a fully functional prototype 
                delivered in a day, and that was motivating. Because I could get a playable game produced so early, 
                I was able to focus more time on the art, as that is what I believe really sells a simple game. I 
                cannot claim to be a talented artist, but after competing in 3D animation for 3 years, I can tell 
                if something looks attractive or not and work it out. After little time of developing prettier 
                assets for the game, I published it and can proudly say that Rapid Run is the best mobile game 
                I have made!

            <h2>TRAILER VIEWER</h2>
            <p>This Windows Forms application was made in response to my workplace's need to allow 
                customers to easily view a movie's cinematic trailer. At the time, I was taking my first 
                C# programming course at Umpqua Community College on top of the knowledge I gained from 
                learning the Unity game engine in C#. With a little help from a classmate, I made my first 
                useful application that soon made it into production.<br/><br/>
                The idea was simple: await a user's barcode scan, perform a table lookup on the barcode, 
                then access its youtube trailer URL and load it. Each unique movie title has a barcode on 
                the back of its case, and most of those barcodes are in the store database assigned to their 
                respective titles. The tricky part was getting those URLs into the lookup table. A classmate 
                suggested I use the title of the movie to perform a youtube search and extract the html. I 
                could then obtain the URL of the first search result and store it in the table if that entry 
                didn't already have one. This proved to be quite difficult for me at the time, but it was 
                well worth it.<br/><br/>
                Some important things I learned from this project were how crucial the choice of data 
                structures you use is (a C# List object was very slow for searching through 15,000 items), 
                the idea of asynchronous methods and how to use them, and the process of turning a customer's 
                needs into a working application.

            <h2>LUFY JUMP</h2>
            <p>My first fun-filled professional project came in the form of a frozen yogurt themed arcade game. 
                Although it was heavily inspired by the sensational mobile game 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird" target="_blank">Flappy Bird</a>, I was not 
                short of new challenges to face and overcome.<br/><br/>
                For this project, I used Game Maker 8 as it facilitated my only experience in programming at the 
                time. I created all the art and logic, and I developed it with the use of a controller in mind. 
                After implementing an online scoreboard for the game, and with the risks of public use at hand, 
                I ran into my first challenge: profanity. The obvious solution was to create a profanity filter, 
                but this proved to be full of nuanced challenges in itself I hadn't anticipated. What if the user 
                put zeros instead of the letter 'o'? What if the user put spaces between letters to pass their 
                profanity? The profanity filter solution turned out to be quite a task. I implemented a simple 
                form of the filter while the risk of users circumventing it were low, but would continue to 
                develop better solutions.
